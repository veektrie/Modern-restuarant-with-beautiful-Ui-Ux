This project was developed using React and CSS. This project is fully responsive and optimized for all devices, making it easy for customers to access and navigate from any device.
One of the standout features of this project is the video section, where customers can watch promotional videos and get a feel for the atmosphere of the restaurant. The Instagram section is also a highlight, allowing customers to browse through beautiful images of the dishes and get a taste of what's on the menu.
But that's not all - the project also includes a menu section where customers can view our full selection of dishes and drinks, as well as a reservations section where they can easily book a table at the restaurant.

Overall,the new restaurant project is a user-friendly and visually stunning way for customers to learn more about the restaurant and make a reservation. We can't wait for you to check it out! #restaurantproject #react #css #responsive #video #instagram #menu #reservations
